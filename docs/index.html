<h1>Assignment 5</h1>

<strong>What did you learn?</strong>
<p>
  I learned how to use node js in an interesting way so that I can make locally hosted servers on my current device. I also know how to use the certain ports so that I can include specific request urls to be served some certain files. Also some other files that shouldn't be served so you can send them a 404 error accordingly
</p>

<strong>What helped you with this assignment?</strong>
<p>
  I used a lot of the notes from class to help me do this project. It all came down to being able to follow instructions of the class
  
</p>

<strong>Any outside reasourecs used?</strong>
<p>

  In this case no, I was mainly the javascript that I was already familiar with that I would use in terms of this project, all that was new was introduced in lecture pretty well.
